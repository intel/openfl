## 'Core' TaskRunner interfaces before refactoring

### Initializing interface to TaskRunner:
__init__(self, model_provider, **kwargs) - Currently called from the code, should be initialized properly.
.set_data_loader(data_loader) - Called after initialization by Plan on the collaborator node
.set_framework_adapter(FrameworkAdapterPlugin) - Called after initialization by Plan on the collaborator node

### Collaborator interface to TaskRunner:
* .set_optimizer_treatment(self.opt_treatment.name) - during initialization
* .get_required_tensorkeys_for_function(func_name, **kwargs) - before every task call
* .TASK_REGISTRY[func_name] - obtaining task callable, every task call
* .get_train_data_size() - called every train task end sending results
* .get_valid_data_size() - called every valid task end sending results

### TaskRunner interface to framework adapters:
#### The following work with the model and optimizer whatever they are
* .framework_adapter.get_tensor_dict(*args)
* .set_tensor_dict(*args, **kwargs)

### TaskRunner interface to DataLoader:
* .data_loader.get_train_loader() - called before every train task
* .data_loader.get_valid_loader() - called before every valid task
* .get_train_data_size() - forwarded to the Collaborator
* .get_train_valid_size() - forwarded to the Collaborator
